Team:

* Person 1 - Which microservice?
* Francis Belza - Shoes microservice

## Design

## Shoes microservice

Create a Shoe model with these fields: manufacturer, model name, color, photo_url, and bin. I will then build a poller so the shoes microservice can communicate with the wardobe API.

## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
